                    A trade policy is a government policy that affects 
                    the number of goods and services a country exports and imports.
                    A tariff is a tax on an imported good or service. 
                    There are several types of tariffs such as an ad Valorem tariff which is a tariff based on the value of the good that is being imported

                    Trade in general is vital to the economic well-being of a nation, 
                    and trade policies are what keep international trade running as smoothly as it can.
                    An export subsidy encourages the export of goods which increases domestic prices.

                    There are international organizations like the IMF and the WTO that work 
                    to support international trade in a fair 
                    and sustainable way that benefits all nations involved.

                    Trade policies that lean towards free trade are the preferred route taken by economists because 
                    they theorize that the economy will always strive toward equilibrium and efficiency.

                    Protectionist policies are frowned upon since they disrupt 
                    what free trade is trying to achieve because they interfere with the natural flow of the global economy.

                    <li>
                    There are other trade policies such as export credit subsidies, red-tape barriers, 
                    and government procurement that serve to benefit the citizens of the nation, 
                    be it economically or by protecting their health.

                    It provides the citizens of a nation with a greater selection of goods, 
                    opens the country up to a larger consumer base where they can sell their goods, 
                    keeps prices more stable and insulates the country from a disaster such as a failed crop, 
                    and brings in revenue that the country would not be able to generate without trade.
